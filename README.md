ThreeJS (WebGL) 3D first person shooter videogame

The project consists of a simple (3D) web-based first person shooter. It has some elements from other common (and famous) videogames such as: Metroid Prime (shoot sound), Metal Gear Solid (PSX) floors, walls and Halo 3 (HUD). It uses a JavaScript library Three.js in order to produce 3D graphics. Feel free to try it out ;). Oh, it also has support for your PlayStation 3 controller (wired, press PS button) on Mozilla Firefox web browsers.

PS. The radar (HUD) was not finished, BUT the functionality was designed; if you inspect the code and call a global variable 'in_range_targets' in the web console you will get, in polar coordinates: (radius, degrees), all the targets that are within a radius of 5 units of distance (quite close).
